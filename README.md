[![style: very good analysis](https://img.shields.io/badge/style-very_good_analysis-B22C89.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/very_good_analysis)

A collection of opinionated utilities for Flutter and Dart applications, focusing on logging, state utilities, and common development patterns.

## Features

### üîç Structured Logging

A powerful logging system built on top of the `logger` package with:

- Structured log messages with class and method context
- Beautiful console output with emoji support
- Stack trace formatting with async chain support
- Log levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, FATAL
- Optional file output support
- Mixin support for easy integration

```dart
void main() {
  AllenLogger.init();
}

// Basic usage
AllenLogger.info<MyClass>("User logged in", data: {"userId": "123"});
// OR
AllenLogger.info("User logged in", data: {"userId": "123"});

// Using the mixin
class MyService with LoggerMixin<MyService> {
  void doSomething() {
    info("Operation started");
  }
}
```

### ‚ö° State Utilities

A collection of lightweight mixins to handle common state-related tasks in Flutter applications.

#### Async Operation Handler

The `AsyncStateMixin` provides a simple, typed wrapper around async operations with loading, success, and error states. Perfect for handling API calls, data loading, and other async tasks. Features include:

- Automatic loading on widget initialization (configurable via `loadOnInit`)
- Two loading modes: full-screen and alert-only
- Automatic state management via `ValueNotifier`
- Type-safe success state
- Comprehensive error handling with messages and stack traces
- Reload capabilities with different loading modes

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<MyWidget> createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> with AsyncStateMixin<String, MyWidget> {
  @override
  FutureOr<String> fetch() async {
    // Implement your data fetching logic here
    return await dataService.fetchData();
  }
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ValueListenableBuilder(
      valueListenable: stateNotifier,
      builder: (context, state, _) {
        return switch (state) {
          // Full-screen loading
          LoadingOperation(alertOnly: false) => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
          // Alert-only loading (minimal UI disruption)
          LoadingOperation(alertOnly: true) => const SmallLoadingIndicator(),
          // Success with typed data
          SuccessOperation<String>(data: final result) => Text(result),
          // Error with full context
          ErrorOperation(message: final message) => ErrorView(
            message: message,
            onRetry: () => reload(), // Convenient reload method
          ),
        };
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Key Methods:
- `fetch()`: Override to implement your data loading logic
- `load(alertOnly: bool)`: Trigger a load with optional alert-only mode
- `reload({alertOnly = true})`: Convenience method for reloading with alert-only by default
- `errorMessage(exception, stackTrace)`: Override to customize error messages

Usage with Other Mixins:
```dart
class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> 
    with AsyncStateMixin<Data, MyWidget>, LoggerMixin<MyWidget> {
  
  @override
  FutureOr<Data> fetch() async {
    try {
      info('Starting data fetch...');
      final result = await dataService.fetchData();
      info('Fetch completed successfully');
      return result;
    } catch (e, s) {
      error('Fetch failed', error: e, stackTrace: s);
      rethrow;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Stream Subscription Helper

The `StreamSubscriberMixin` and `StreamSubscriberStateMixin` provide convenient utilities for managing stream subscriptions with automatic cleanup:

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<MyWidget> createState() => _MyWidgetState();
}

class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> with StreamSubscriberStateMixin {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Subscription is automatically cleaned up in dispose()
    listen(
      userStream,
      (user) => setState(() => this.user = user),
    );
  }
}
```

### üéØ Utilities

#### Unique ID Generation

Generate unique, sortable, timestamp-based IDs:

```dart
final id = generateId(); // Returns a 20-character string identifier
```

Features of generated IDs:
- Based on timestamps for natural sorting
- Contains 72-bits of random data to prevent collisions
- Lexicographically sortable
- Monotonically increasing
- URL-safe characters

## Getting Started

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  allen_wrench: ^1.0.0
```

### Initialize Logging

```dart
void main() {
  AllenLogger.init(
    enableFileOutput: true,
    filePath: 'logs/app.log',
    printEmojis: true,
    lineLength: 120,
  );
  
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

## Additional Documentation

### Logging Levels

- **TRACE**: Very detailed logs for fine-grained debugging
- **DEBUG**: Development-time debugging information
- **INFO**: General operational events
- **WARNING**: Potentially harmful situations
- **ERROR**: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running
- **FATAL**: Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort

### Operation States

The `AsyncStateMixin` provides three states:

1. **LoadingOperation**: Operation in progress
   ```dart
   LoadingOperation(alertOnly: false)
   ```

2. **SuccessOperation**: Operation completed successfully
   ```dart
   SuccessOperation(data: result)
   ```

3. **ErrorOperation**: Operation failed
   ```dart
   ErrorOperation(
     alertOnly: false,
     message: "Failed to load data",
     exception: e,
     stackTrace: s,
   )
   ```
